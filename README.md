# Test Driven Development by Example

This repo contains my excercises done following the book [Test Driven Development: By Example](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/test-driven-development/0321146530/)  by Kent Beck

## Notes
I'm trying to commit every little change in the code following the book's "narrative evolution".
In this way, should be possible to understand the changes I've been done to code.
